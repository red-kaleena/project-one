## Overview

Students register, log in, add the courses they completed together with their
letter grades, and instantly see their credit-weighted GPA. Every grade can be
updated or a course deleted. The app is a proof of concept built on a
Flask + SQLAlchemy baseline.

## Branch Model

```
feature/* ──PR──▶ dev ──PR──▶ main ──tag──▶ PyPI + Docker
```

- `main` — stable, protected, only via PR from `dev`.
- `dev` — integration branch for all feature work.
- `feature/*` — short-lived branches per task, created from `dev`.
